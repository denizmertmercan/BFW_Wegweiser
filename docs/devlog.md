# Devlog

Running log of notable changes and the reasoning behind them. Complements commit
messages with slightly more context. Each entry is headed by timestamp and
contributor initials. Entries don't map 1:1 to commits. Ordered most recent
first. Covers changes made after forking; upstream history predates this log.

Decoupled the routing pipeline into an offline Python data compiler and a
static browser visualizer, implementing the client-server separation
without requiring an active HTTP server process.

In [src/main.py](src/main.py), removed `matplotlib` and image loading
routines (`load_map()`, `draw_path()`) along with interactive console
prompts. Added `compile_routing_data()` and `export_data()` to precalculate
all routes from `startpunkt` to checkpoints and serialize coordinates,
destinations, and route paths directly into [web/data.json](web/data.json).

In [web/script.js](web/script.js), removed hardcoded network tables
(`connections`, `points`, `destinations`) and the client-side BFS
`findPath()` implementation, which previously appeared to exhibit a directed-edge
traversal bug. Added `loadRoutingData()` to asynchronously fetch
[web/data.json](web/data.json) on startup and resolve paths via constant-time
lookup (`appData.routes[destination]`), binding coordinates directly
to the SVG route overlay.

In [web/index.html](web/index.html), updated the floor plan image reference to
[web/assets/Grundriss_mit_Knotenpunkten.png](web/assets/Grundriss_mit_Knotenpunkten.png),
ensuring the static client remains self-contained. In [src/test_main.py](src/test_main.py),
removed headless matplotlib backend configuration and added
`test_compile_routing_data_structure` to verify the compiled data output.

Reorganized the repository into a symmetrical two-tier layout separating
offline Python tooling from static web assets.

Moved [src/main.py](src/main.py) and [src/test_main.py](src/test_main.py)
into [src/](src/). Relocated the map asset into
[web/assets/Grundriss_mit_Knotenpunkten.png](web/assets/Grundriss_mit_Knotenpunkten.png)
so static hosting environments may serve the site without parent directory traversal.
Imported baseline frontend files ([web/index.html](web/index.html),
[web/script.js](web/script.js), [web/style.css](web/style.css)) from the
original author's repository into [web/](web/) as a starting point for the
client interface.

Added [docs/adr_directory_structure.md](docs/adr_directory_structure.md)
evaluating repository layout options (such as [src/](src/) and [web/](web/)
versus builder and viewer pairings), documenting the choice of [src/](src/)
and [web/](web/) for standard Python tooling and static host compatibility.
Added [docs/current_state.md](docs/current_state.md) to record the active baseline
and next milestones. Added an initial [README.md](README.md) describing the
two-tier architecture, directory structure, and local execution instructions.

Documented a temporary branch synchronization strategy in
[docs/temp_branch_strategy.md](docs/temp_branch_strategy.md) to coordinate
work across multiple development machines.

Because the secondary machine holds unpushed local commits on `main`
(including architectural decision records), pushing new work directly to
`origin/main` from this machine would likely cause branch divergence.
Established the procedure to isolate the script-splitting changes on a
temporary `script-split` branch, rebase onto local `main` on the secondary
machine, fast-forward merge, and delete `script-split` to preserve a clean,
linear history. Initialized the `script-split` branch under this workflow.

Added type hints to `build_graph`/`find_path` parameters — the minimum
needed for Pylance's Basic type-checking mode to catch call-site type
mismatches. Return types and local variables are already inferred
automatically by Pylance, so left unannotated to keep the change minimal.
Earlier attempt annotated the whole file (module-level data, return types,
locals); reverted in favor of this minimal version so the import-removal,
debug-cleanup, and type-hint changes could each land as their own commit.

## 2026-09-03 09:15 - DM

Removed obsolete debug print statements from `main()`
(`print(user_input)`, `print(os.getcwd())`, `print(os.listdir())`). These
were leftover artifacts from debugging the original hardcoded image-path
bug and served no purpose for the end user once the path was fixed.

Commits: `1b87f1b`

## 2026-09-03 09:14 - DM

Removed a redundant `deque` import inside `find_path()` — it was already
imported at module level, so the inner import was dead duplication left
over from earlier iterations. No behavior change.

## 2026-09-03 08:26 - DM

Established the project's language convention and renamed all German
identifiers to English accordingly: identifiers, code structure, commit
messages, and docs stay English; comments and user-facing strings stay
German for the course's German-speaking audience. Graph node label
*values* (e.g. `"knoten_1"`, `"startpunkt"`, `"ost_1"`) were deliberately
left German too — they share one namespace with user-typed checkpoint
names (which must stay German), so keeping the whole namespace uniform
avoided a worse, mixed-language graph. Renamed: `startpunkt`→`start_point`,
`knotenpunkte`→`nodes`, `verbindungen`→`connections` (incl. its
`verbindungN`→`connectionN` keys), `nutzer_eingabe`→`user_input`,
`punkt_a`/`punkt_b`→`point_a`/`point_b`, `karte`→`map_image`, `ziel`→
`target`, `weg`→`path`.

Added `__pycache__` to `.gitignore`. The folder was generated as a side
effect of testing `import main` (to verify the `__main__` guard below
doesn't trigger side effects on import) and showed up as untracked —
Python's compiled bytecode cache should never be version-controlled.

## 2026-09-02 14:01 - DM

Wrapped executable script logic in a `main()` function guarded by
`if __name__ == "__main__":`. Previously, every line (input prompt, image
loading, pathfinding) executed immediately at module load, so importing
`main.py` from elsewhere would trigger all of it as a side effect. Data
and function definitions stay at module level; only the runtime logic
moved into `main()`. No behavior change — verified with a piped-input
test run and an `import main` test.

## 2026-09-02 13:50 - DM

Added validation for the user's checkpoint input. Previously, an invalid
target string caused `find_path` to silently return `None`, printing
`Pfad: None` with no explanation. Now checks the input against
`checkpoints` and prints a clear German error message before exiting.

Added error handling around `plt.imread()`. A missing or renamed map
image previously crashed with an unhandled traceback; now fails with a
clear German error message instead.

## 2026-09-02 13:41 - DM

Fixed the hardcoded absolute path to `Grundriss_mit_Knotenpunkten.png`
(originally pointing to the original author's local machine path,
`E:\TN_Daten\Schmitz\Code_Projekts\...`), which broke the script for any
other contributor. Now resolved relative to the script's own directory
via `__file__`, independent of the caller's working directory.

## 2026-09-02 13:18 - DM

Added `images/` to `.gitignore`. While deciding where the map image
should live, it was briefly moved into an `images/` subfolder and then
back to the project root (kept at root, since it's a required runtime
asset, consistent with the original author's layout). Along the way, an
unrelated `images/` folder containing personal photos appeared in the
working directory (likely synced in from elsewhere) — excluded via
`.gitignore` rather than tracked.

## 2026-09-01 14:02 - DM

Updated the environment snapshot doc after upgrading `pip`/`setuptools`/
`wheel` globally and creating the project's `.venv` with `matplotlib`
installed. Reformatted the table into Global vs. Project venv sections.

Commits: `2089dd8`

## 2026-09-01 13:47 - DM

Added `.venv/` to `.gitignore` after creating the project's virtual
environment, so it isn't accidentally committed.

Commits: `8cee102`

## 2026-09-01 13:41 - DM

Created `docs/environment_snapshot.md` to record installed tool versions
(Python, pip, Git, VS Code, PowerShell) at project setup time, for
reproducibility and onboarding as a new contributor to the fork.
